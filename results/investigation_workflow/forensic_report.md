## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Triage

**Objective**: Initial incident assessment and scope determination  

**Forensic Actions**:
- Review incident report and available evidence sources
- Identify affected systems and time window
- Determine evidence availability across layers
- Assess investigation feasibility and limitations
- Establish investigation priorities

### Step 2: Cross-Layer Validation

**Objective**: Correlate evidence across network and host layers to validate incident  

**Forensic Actions**:
- Align network and host timelines (accounting for ±30s uncertainty)
- Correlate network traffic patterns with host system state
- Validate temporal causality (network → host propagation)
- Identify corroborating evidence across layers
- Document evidence chain and correlation strength

### Step 3: Characterization

**Objective**: Determine attack type, method, sophistication, and threat actor profile  

**Forensic Actions**:
- Analyze network traffic patterns for attack fingerprints
- Classify attack type based on protocol and behavior
- Assess attack sophistication and automation level
- Profile potential threat actor based on TTPs
- Compare with known attack patterns

### Step 4: Impact Assessment

**Objective**: Quantify attack impact on system availability, performance, and operations  

**Forensic Actions**:
- Measure resource consumption during attack
- Assess service availability degradation
- Quantify performance impact
- Evaluate data integrity (no compromise expected for DoS)
- Calculate recovery time and costs

### Step 5: Timeline Reconstruction

**Objective**: Build comprehensive incident timeline with complete chain of evidence  

**Forensic Actions**:
- Compile all temporal evidence from network and host layers
- Establish incident chronology with confidence levels
- Document evidence provenance and chain of custody
- Identify critical decision points and indicators
- Generate forensic report suitable for legal proceedings

## Key Findings

1. **Attack Confirmed**: YES - DoS attack (ICMP Flood)
2. **Evidence Corroboration**: CONFIRMED - Network and Host evidence mutually support DoS hypothesis
3. **Attack Classification**: T1498.001 - Network Flood (ICMP Flood)
4. **Impact Severity**: MEDIUM
5. **Data Integrity**: NO COMPROMISE (DoS attack)

---

## Limitations

- Host absolute timestamps estimated (±30s uncertainty)
- Power layer unavailable (different experimental session)
- Attack end time unknown (investigation window only)
- Attribution limited to IP addresses (no OSINT correlation)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- Block identified source IPs
- Implement ICMP rate limiting
- Monitor for repeat attacks

### Short-Term Actions
- Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS)
- Enhance logging for all layers
- Improve timestamp synchronization (NTP/GPS)

### Long-Term Actions
- Multi-layer real-time correlation system
- Automated incident response playbooks
- Regular security assessments

---

**Legal Admissibility**: MEDIUM - Suitable for incident response, limitations must be disclosed for legal proceedings  
**Chain of Custody**: MAINTAINED - reproducible analysis
