| Scenario | Layer Pair | Optimal Lag (s) | r | p-value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DoS | Network → Host | -6 | 0.642 | <0.0001 | NETWORK leads HOST by 6 seconds |
| DoS | Host → Power | -4 | 1.000 | <0.0001 | HOST leads POWER by 4 seconds |
| DoS | Network → Power | -7 | 1.000 | <0.0001 | NETWORK leads POWER by 7 seconds |
| Recon | Network → Host | -1 | 0.825 | <0.0001 | NETWORK leads HOST by 1 seconds |
| Recon | Host → Power | -6 | 1.000 | <0.0001 | HOST leads POWER by 6 seconds |
| Recon | Network → Power | -7 | 1.000 | 0.0003 | NETWORK leads POWER by 7 seconds |

**Notes**:
- Optimal Lag: Time shift (seconds) that maximizes |r|
- Negative lag: First layer leads second layer
- Positive lag: Second layer leads first layer
- r: Pearson correlation coefficient (-1 to +1)
- p-value: Statistical significance (α=0.05)
- Interpretation: Temporal relationship between layers

## Key Findings

### Attack Propagation Patterns

**DoS Attack**:
- Network → Host: 6-second propagation delay (r=0.642)
- Host → Power: 4-second propagation delay (r=1.000)
- Total propagation: Network → Host (6s) → Power (4s)

**Recon Attack**:
- Network → Host: 1-second propagation delay (r=0.825) - instant!
- Host → Power: 6-second propagation delay (r=1.000)
- Rapid reconnaissance burst at attack onset

**Cryptojacking Attack**:
- Host → Power: 6-second propagation delay (r=0.997)
- No network component (host-originated)
- Gradual intensity buildup (late peak at 48s)

### Temporal Evolution Insights

**Phase Characteristics**:
- DoS: Rapid decline after initiation (-0.004 trend in peak phase)
- Recon: Steepest decline (-0.13 trend in initiation)
- Cryptojacking: Gradual increase (+0.003 trend in initiation)

**Critical Events**:
- DoS peak: 7 seconds after attack start
- Recon peak: Immediate (0-1 seconds)
- Cryptojacking peak: Late (48 seconds)
