## Implications for Forensic Reconstruction

### Attack-Adaptive Temporal Alignment

**Reconnaissance**:

## Recommendations for Publication

### Reporting Strategy

**Unified Statement**:
"Multi-layer temporal correlation analysis reveals attack-type specific propagation patterns: Reconnaissance shows rapid 1-second Network→Host propagation (r=0.825, p<0.0001), DOS exhibits moderate 6-second propagation (r=0.642, p<0.0001), and Cryptojacking validates host-originated attacks with near-perfect 6-second Host→Power correlation (r=0.997, p<0.0001). These findings demonstrate the necessity of attack-adaptive temporal alignment and layer selection in forensic event reconstruction."

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Small Sample Sizes**:
   - Cryptojacking: n=5 at optimal lag
   - Limited by sparse power data availability

2. **Attack Variant Aggregation**:
   - Reconnaissance aggregates scan types (port, service, vuln)
   - Individual scan-type variance not quantified

3. **Attack Intensity**:
   - No analysis of lag dependence on attack intensity
   - Reconnaissance scan rate not varied

### Recommended Future Work

**High Priority**:
1. Expand Cryptojacking sample size with additional power data
2. Analyze individual reconnaissance scan types separately
3. Study attack intensity impact on propagation lag

**Medium Priority**:
4. Sub-second analysis for rapid Reconnaissance propagation
5. Extended temporal windows for full attack lifecycle
