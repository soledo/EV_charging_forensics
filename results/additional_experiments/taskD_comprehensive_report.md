## 📊 Detection Performance Results

### Confusion Matrices

#### Network-Only Detection
```
                Predicted
                BENIGN  ATTACK
Actual BENIGN        1       0
       ATTACK        1       2
```

**Accuracy**: 75.0%
**Issue**: Failed to detect host-originated attacks (Cryptojacking)

#### Host-Only Detection
```
                Predicted
                BENIGN  ATTACK
Actual BENIGN        1       0
       ATTACK        0       3
```

**Accuracy**: 100.0%
**Strength**: Detected all attack types including host-originated

#### Multi-Layer Detection (Proposed)
```
                Predicted
                BENIGN  ATTACK
Actual BENIGN        1       0
       ATTACK        0       3
```

**Accuracy**: 100.0%
**Advantage**: Attack-adaptive layer selection ensures complete coverage

## 🎯 Multi-Layer Detection Advantages

### 1. Attack-Adaptive Layer Selection
- **Network-originated attacks**: Use Network→Host correlation
- **Host-originated attacks**: Use Host→Power correlation
- **Result**: Complete attack coverage across all attack vectors

### 2. Reduced False Negatives
- **FNR improvement**: 33.3% reduction
- **Missed attacks**: 0 (perfect recall on test set)
- **Operational impact**: No attacks slip through undetected

### 3. Maintained False Positive Rate
- **FPR**: 0.0% (low)
- **False alarms**: Minimal impact on operations
- **Trade-off**: High detection without excessive false alarms

### 4. Robustness Across Attack Types
- **DoS**: Detected via Network→Host (r=0.642)
- **Reconnaissance**: Detected via Network→Host (r=0.825)
- **Cryptojacking**: Detected via Host→Power (r=0.997)

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Benign Scenarios**: Only 1 benign scenario tested
   - **Impact**: False positive rate may be underestimated
   - **Mitigation**: Expand benign dataset with diverse normal operations

2. **Simulated Benign Correlation**: Used estimated r=0.15 for normal charging
   - **Impact**: Ground truth benign correlation not measured
   - **Mitigation**: Analyze actual benign charging data from dataset

3. **Small Sample Size**: 4 scenarios total (3 attacks + 1 benign)
   - **Impact**: Statistical power limited
   - **Mitigation**: Priority 2 analysis with n≥10 per attack type

4. **Threshold Optimization**: Fixed thresholds not empirically optimized
   - **Impact**: May not be optimal for all deployment scenarios
   - **Mitigation**: ROC curve analysis for threshold tuning

### Future Enhancements

1. **Benign Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze 100+ hours of normal charging data
   - Establish baseline correlation distributions
   - Empirically measure false positive rate

2. **Threshold Optimization**:
   - ROC curve analysis for each layer
   - Optimal threshold selection based on operational requirements
   - Cost-sensitive optimization (weight FP vs FN differently)

3. **Cross-Validation**:
   - K-fold validation with multiple attack instances
   - Leave-one-out analysis for generalization
   - Temporal validation (train on early data, test on later)

4. **Real-Time Performance**:
   - Computational complexity analysis
   - Real-time detection latency measurement
   - Resource utilization profiling
